2025 New York QSO Party - Data Quality Errata
===============================================

This file documents data quality issues encountered during log processing.
No individual callsigns are listed to avoid discouraging participation.

MISSING CLAIMED SCORES
---------------------
Issue: 31 out of 508 submitted logs (6.1%) were missing claimed scores
Cause: Either no CLAIMED-SCORE: line in Cabrillo header, or empty value
Impact: These logs excluded from score-based statistical analysis (box plots)
Note: Logs still counted in participation statistics and QSO totals

Examples of missing score formats:
- CLAIMED-SCORE: (empty value)
- Missing CLAIMED-SCORE: line entirely

RECOMMENDATION FOR FUTURE CONTESTS
----------------------------------
Contest software should validate Cabrillo headers before submission to ensure
all required fields are populated, particularly CLAIMED-SCORE.

STATISTICS AFFECTED
------------------
- Box Plot of Score by Category: Uses 477 logs with valid scores
- All other charts and statistics: Use complete dataset of 508 logs
